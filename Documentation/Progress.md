## Daily notes

#### 20th June 2019
- Morning: Got the doc from Callum.
- 15.00: Had some free time at work, decided to setup the project on GitHub private. My approach was starting from Item 1 (Farming) with single player mode to get myself familiar with UE4 - from what I'd read earlier about the UE4's multiplayer architecture, it should be easy to switch from single to multi.
- 15.15: Things got set up nicely. Time to commit.
- 15.40: Got another bunch of free time at work. I'm gonna get rid of mouse-based navigation and switch to arrow key-based navigation.
